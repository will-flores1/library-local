# Problem solving process:  
### 1. Understand the Problem
**Input**: USER enters book information into form then clicks 'add book'  
**Output**: USER book information is displayed in the 'my books' sections  
**Constraints**: we need to add books, remove books, and display books  
**Questions**:

- [ ] How do I loop through an array and display the objects property values?  
- [x] How do I connect the DOM elements to my javascript functions?  
- [ ] How do I add DOM elements to a page when a button is clicked?  
- [x] How do I better name variables and classes? Dictionary.com inspiration from definitions and synonyms
- [x] How do I collect form information in javascript?
....  


### 2. Break down problem into small steps
- Create HTML/CSS skeleton
- Write a function that can take user's input and store the new book objects in an array
- Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page
- Add a 'new book' button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book(author, title, pages, read)
- Add a button on each books display to remove the book from the library
- Add a button on each books display to changes its 'read' status

### 3. Convert each step into code
### 4. Execute code (and debug)
